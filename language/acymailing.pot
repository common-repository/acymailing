msgstr ""

msgid "This rule will automatically handle Amazon SES's response when sending an email is denied due to the user being on their suppression list. By default, this rule will automatically disable this user from your list."
msgstr ""

msgid "This rule will run on messages that require action on your part. This kind of message needs to be handled manually, you can forward them to a webmaster and manage them one by one. By default, this rule will handle all auto-replies like 'click here to confirm you are human' or 'reply to this newsletter leaving the subject line intact'."
msgstr ""

msgid "This rule will remove notification messages such as 'I am on vacation' or 'thank you for your message' from the subject line. By default, we simply want to ignore these. It will only be detected based on the subject line."
msgstr ""

msgid "This rule will handle feedback loop complaints."
msgstr ""

msgid "This rule will handle feedback loop complaints when the message is located in the body of the bounce email."
msgstr ""

msgid "This rule will handle undelivered messages due to the recipient's inbox being full. By default, we do not want to immediately block this user. AcyMailing will wait for 3 soft bounce messages before taking action on this subscriber."

msgstr ""

msgid "This rule will handle bounce messages indicating that the mailbox could not be reached because it does not exist."
msgstr ""

msgid "This rule will handle messages that could not be delivered because your message was blocked by a filter. By default, Acymailing will forward you these messages so you can investigate the problem."
msgstr ""

msgid "This rule will handle bounce messages indicating that the mailbox could not be reached because it does not exist. Both rules are necessary to cover most bounce messages of this type."
msgstr ""

msgid "This rule will handle bounce messages indicating that the mailbox could not be reached because the domain name does not exist. The mailbox or the recipient's domain does not exist, so by default, we will immediately block the user from being contacted again."
msgstr ""

msgid "This rule will handle other soft bounces such as temporary unavailability of the recipient's mailbox. By default, AcyMailing will only take action on the subscriber if it receives at least 3 soft bounces from this user."
msgstr ""

msgid "This rule will handle what we call 'hard bounces'. It will process on messages that we could not catch with the previous rules 'The mailbox does not exist' and 'The domain does not exist'."
msgstr ""

msgid "This rule will remove notification messages such as 'thank you for contacting us...' if they are included in the body of the bounce email. It will only be detected based on the body."
msgstr ""

msgid "This rule will be executed if a message does not match any of the previous rules. By default, this kind of message is redirected to your email address so you can manually process it or improve the rules to handle it automatically."
